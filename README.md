# Three-Dee
a tiny collection of 3D demos / tests.

---

### What Is This ?
these are just a bunch of demos / tests featuring simple implementations<br>
of basic 3D concepts such as rasterization (and more ?).

you could see this as a learning project for me to learn the basic concepts of 3D.<br>
i do not know if i am doing any of these concepts correctly ;-;

### Demos
visit [the page](https://nectarboy.github.io/three-dee) to see these for yourself :)<br>
so, here are all the demos so far !
